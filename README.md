# Central Park Squirrel Census Data Analysis

This Python script analyzes the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data to determine the count of squirrels based on their primary fur color. It then creates a modified CSV file with the count of gray, cinnamon, and black squirrels.

## Usage

1. **Download Data File:**
   - Ensure you have the CSV file named `004 2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data.csv` in the `Data_File` directory.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the `main.py` script.
   - The script will read the data from the CSV file, analyze the squirrel counts based on primary fur color, and create a modified CSV file named `Modified_CSV.csv` in the `Data_File` directory.
